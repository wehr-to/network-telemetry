# network-telemetry
Scripts and labs to collect, normalize, and visualize network telemetry — including **NetFlow**, **SNMP**, and **Syslog** — using **ELK Stack** and **Grafana**.  This repo helps you build visibility pipelines for network performance, security, and anomaly detection across routers, switches, firewalls, and virtual labs.
